# React Native: Accessing State Before Component Mount

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native: attempting to access component state or props before the component has fully mounted. This often manifests when dealing with asynchronous operations within lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount` or the `useEffect` hook.

## The Problem

The `bug.js` file illustrates the issue.  An asynchronous operation fetches data, and the state is updated with the fetched data.  However, if the component attempts to render before the asynchronous operation completes, unexpected behavior (e.g., rendering `null` or undefined data, errors) might occur.

## The Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file offers a solution.  This involves conditionally rendering elements while the asynchronous operation is in progress, preventing the component from attempting to use the state before it's ready.  This typically involves a loading indicator or placeholder.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `react-native run-android` or `react-native run-ios`
4. Observe the behavior in both `bug.js` and `bugSolution.js` to see the difference
